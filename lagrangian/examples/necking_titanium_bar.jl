# Tensile necking of a notched titanium round bar (finite strain, F-bar).
#
# The classic large-strain plasticity benchmark: a circular bar pulled in tension
# develops a localized **neck** that runs away to failure. A perfect bar would
# deform uniformly, so we seed a single **tiny notch** (a ~1.5% radius reduction
# at mid-length) to localize the neck at a known place. This is a genuinely 3D,
# large-rotation, near-incompressible plastic problem — exactly what the
# finite-strain F-bar element (`element=:finite_fbar`) is for.
#
# Mesh (as specified):
#   • circular cross-section meshed by an all-hex O-grid (concentric square→disk
#     map): ncross=10 ⇒ 10×10 = **100 cells per cross-section**.
#   • **200 elements along the length**, axially GRADED — fine near the mid-length
#     notch (to resolve the neck) and coarsening toward the gripped ends.
#   ⇒ 100×200 = 20,000 Hex8 elements, (11²·201)=24,321 nodes, ~73k DOFs.
#
# Material: Ti-6Al-4V (representative, linearized hardening).
#
# F-bar ⇒ non-symmetric tangent ⇒ `solve!` auto-selects the direct (UMFPACK)
# solver (CG+AMG is for the structured-box scaling path, not this graded mesh).
# This is a sizeable run (120 load steps, direct solver); reduce
# `ncross`/`naxial`/`nsteps` for a quick look. We pull to 9% elongation: by then
# the neck is well developed (~11% radius reduction), and it stays below the ~9.6%
# elongation at which a distorted grip-corner O-grid element folds (a mesh limit,
# not a step-size issue — more `nsteps` does not push past it; a less distorted
# grip mesh would). Run with threads for the assembly:
#   julia -t auto --project=. examples/necking_titanium_bar.jl

Solid circular bar (axis = x, radius R0, length L) of Hex8 elements:
- cross-section: `ncross`×`ncross` O-grid cells (concentric square→disk map);
- axial: `naxial` (even) elements, geometrically GRADED so the smallest elements
  sit at the mid-length notch (ratio `grade` between successive element sizes from
  the centre out), coarsening toward the ends;
- notch: the cross-section radius dips to `R0·(1 − notch_amp)` in a narrow Gaussian
  of width `notch_width` centred at x = L/2 — the imperfection that localizes the neck.
